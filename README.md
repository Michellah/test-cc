# COMPLEXITY
## Before:
1. Actions for user input were unclear.
2. Excessive use of if else in the simulateRiceCooker section.
## After:
1. Improved loop structure: The simulation loop manages user inputs to perform selected actions.
2. More precise conditions in rice cooker methods to manage states before executing an action.
3. Saves time by removing unnecessary conditions
